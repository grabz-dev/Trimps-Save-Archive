# Trimps-Save-Archive
An interactive archive of Trimps saves from contributors in the Trimps community.   
https://grabz-dev.github.io/Trimps-Save-Archive/

# How to build this yourself
This website requires JSON files to be placed inside the `output` folder that contain individual save files.  
To build these:
* Create a `saves` directory.
* In this directory, create a new directory named after the person who contributed the saves.
* In that new directory, place the .txt files with Trimps saves. You should have something akin to this: `saves/Grabz/Trimps Save P9 Z41.txt`
* Run `jsonify_saves.bat`. This will generate the required JSON files inside the `output` folder.
* Finally, at the top of `main.js`, add the name(s) corresponding to the folder names you have created before and built json files from.
